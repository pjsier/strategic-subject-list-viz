        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>The map shows the distribution of contact card stops by CPD in Chicago
        against the distribution of individuals with SSL scores by the census tract of
        their most recent arrests. The grouped dots are scaled by the number of
        contact card stops, while the census tracts are scaled by the number of
        individuals with their most recent arrest on the SSL in that tract.</p>
