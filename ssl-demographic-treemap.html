        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Treemap arranging sizes by count of individuals with SSL scores. Each
        rectangle represents a individuals grouped by race, sex, and age group, and
        sizes are determined by the number of individuals with an SSL score with
        those demographics. Some individuals are either listed as race "Unknown",
        which is grouped with American Indian/Alaskan Native due to very little
        representation. There were fewer than 100 individuals listed with sex as "X"
        instead of "M" or "F", so they are not included here.</p>
